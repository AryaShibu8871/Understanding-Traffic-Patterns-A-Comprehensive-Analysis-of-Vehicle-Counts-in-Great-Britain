# Understanding-Traffic-Patterns-A-Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Vehicle-Counts-in-Great-Britain
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting vehicle traffic counts across Great Britain using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset comprises historical vehicle counts, enriched with contextual features such as location, year, day of the week, and month.

Key highlights:

Analyzed UK traffic data to forecast vehicle counts based on location, year, month, and day of the week.

Built and evaluated multiple models, including LSTM, GRU, and SVM, with LSTM and GRU delivering the best performance.

Developed category-wise prediction models and visualized traffic trends through data analysis and plotting.

Deployed a Flask-based web application for real-time traffic prediction.

Tools and technologies used:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Flask.
