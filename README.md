This project analyses road traffic data from Great Britain to understand how vehicle volumes vary across locations and time. The study examines the impact of factors such as location, year, month, and day of the week, supported by visual analysis of traffic patterns.
Machine learning models including LSTM, GRU, and SVM are developed to predict vehicle counts for different vehicle categories. Model evaluation shows that LSTM and GRU achieve the best performance. These models are deployed in a web application that predicts traffic volumes based on user-selected inputs.
